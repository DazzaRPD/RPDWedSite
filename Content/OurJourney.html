<h1>Our Journey</h1>

<!---BlockOne--->
<h2>15 June 2016</h2>
<p>Their eyes met across the Web...</p>

<p>Somewhat controversially (more on that later), we both met on Tinder. Kari "swiped right" on me first, and Darren, after a chance browsing session, then swiped right myself. Tinder did it's celebration thing, and after many, many long paragraphs (Darren's choice, much to Kari's displeasure), numbers were exchanged and the conversation continued on Whatsapp. The rest, as they say, is history
<br />
I (Darren) still marvel at how Kari was determined to stay with me, especially after having to stop talking to her to attend a cricket Committee meeting. I was enjoying the conversation so much, and didn't want it to end. Fortunately, it didn't.

<!---Block2--->
<h2>22 June 2016</h2>
<p>The first official meeting</p>
<p>After multiple conversations, only interrupted by battery drains and work, our happy couple decided to take the plunge and meet each other. Unfortunately, Darren didn't drive and so Kari came to Campus on a Wednesday afternoon. With lunchboxes at the ready, the 2 talked over leftover vetkoek and pizza (which they traded half of), and our story continues.
<br />
<!---Kari's thoughts here--->
</p>

<h2>25 June 2016<h2>
<p>An exposure to our future diet</p>
<p>Trying to be a knight in armour, Darren agreed to attend a Banting Market in Modderfontein (the Val Bonne Country Estate), to stop Kari going alone. However, the transport issue reared its head. So Kari proposed picking him up along the way, at Marlboro Gautrain. Darren tried to be chivalrous (to prevent Kari having a close brush with Alexandra township), but Kari's independence was having none of it. Anyway, Marlboro it was, and an enjoyable day was had.</p>

<!---Block4 - Meeting the Minion--->
<h2>21 August 2016</h2>
<p>Meeting the Minion</p>
<p>After several Banting Markets and Campus lunches, it was time for us to start meeting each other's families. This included another exciting adventure, to see the Rand Airshow (given Kari's history with planes and Darren's frequent flying). However, Darren's youngest sister Amber tagged along for the ride. At one point during the proceedings, Amber asked Darren in private if this was going to be serious someday. Darren confirmed it would be, someday</p>
<!---Block5 - "They almost held hands" - SW --->
<h2>10 September 2016</h2>
<p>Almost holding hands...</p>
<p>One of Kari's dreams has been to do the Jacaranda Spring Walk of 5km, but the problem is she had nobody to go with. Darren (reprising his knight in shining armour role from earlier) stepped up, and both finished quite happily. However, it was revealed later that the day could've gone better, as Kari wanted to hold hands, but didn't feel comfortable, yet.</p>

<!---Block6 - 2nd Airshow - First Kiss"--->
<h2>18 September 2016</h2>
<p>The first kiss</p>
<p>Another airshow, but this time with Darren's other sister, Jade. Cold, wet and dreary conditions awaited us, and unfortunately no planes could fly. Despite the disappointment of in-air action, we got to see inside a military plane, took a few walks around the other exhibits, with some cold coffee. Then, it was time to go, and with the car packed up and Jade and friend safely in the warmth of the car, Darren gave Kari something she'd been waiting for for 26 years, her first kiss.</p>
